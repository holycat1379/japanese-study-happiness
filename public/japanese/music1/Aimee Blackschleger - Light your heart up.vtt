00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.680
Because you seem feeling down

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.680
因为你看起来感觉失落

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.110
I've been trying to calm & fade it

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.110
我试着让你静下来 淡忘往事

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.360
But you don't wanna turn around

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.360
但你并不想有所转变

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.990
Teenage is so complicated

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.990
年轻人的心中所想总是如此复杂

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:30.970
Cmon, cmon

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:30.970
加油 来吧

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.710
Ain't no one who can take your place

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.710
一定会有人能读懂你的心

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.580
Oh baby...please let me see you smiling

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.580
让我看到你的笑容

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.350
It's such a pain in the neck we have homework by tomorrow

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.350
明天就要交家庭作业是何其令人生厌的事情

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.290
I know you're not a person who would be worn out with sorrow

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.290
我知晓你并不是一个只知悲伤的人

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.590
告别过去真是不容易 还带着些许的迷惘

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:57.530
To fly away from your past is not so easy but dizzy

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:58.780
Keep your faith

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:58.780
坚守你的初衷与信念

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.200

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.200
仰起你年轻果敢的脸

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.430
Just get rid of your broken wings

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.430
忘记曾经破碎的翅膀

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.160
You're strong enough by now

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.160
如今你已足够强大

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.160
I'll be your spark when you're lost in the dark

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.160
当你迷失在黑暗中 让我做你的启明之光

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.580
And let me be your sun, be your match to

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.580
让我作为你的太阳 为你指引前进的方向

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.000

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.000
点亮你的心灵

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.370

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.370
点亮你的心灵

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.330
If you want to

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.330
如果你愿意如此

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:36.040
Light your heart up

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:36.040
点亮你的心灵

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.380
Besides you lead a winding road

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.380
你身旁是条蜿蜒扭曲的路

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.320
There're some troubles make you stumble

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.320
一路上会遇到如此多的困难阻碍你前行

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.040
But you're gonna beat them all

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.040
但你一定要战胜他们

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.040
Loner girl is hard to crumble

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.040
孤独少女 却很少崩溃

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.010
I know, I know

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.010
我知道 我知道

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.140
Ain't no one who can touch your heart

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.140
一定会有人能读懂你的心

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.290
But baby...please let me see you crying

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.290
让我看到你的笑容

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.920
You're sort of square

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.920
你是多么老实呀

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.760
Why don't we ditch that class?

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.760
为什么我们不选择翘课呢

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.320
It's time to chill out

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.320
是时候冷静下来

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.070
I know you're not a person who would get excited and shout

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.070
我知晓你不是一个激动的女孩

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:14.430
The sky above your thick cloud is not so gritty but pretty

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:14.430
叆叇的天空上面 并不是那么坚强却漂亮

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.990

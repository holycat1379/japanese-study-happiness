00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:25.500
Oh Take a look in the mirror you look so sad

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:25.500
镜子里的你 看上去那么悲伤

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.800
It's so cold like that winter market we used to go

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.800
寒冷的感觉 如同我们曾经常去的冬季市场

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:42.000
I don't cry anymore but I feel so hurt

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:42.000
我不会再哭了 可是悲伤却未曾减少

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.570
So I don't need you to close to me

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.570
所以我不需要你在身边

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.790
You don't hear me so you said

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.790
你未曾听到我说什么 所以你说

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:57.140
I don't know why things have changed since yesterday

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:57.140
我不知道为什么 从昨天起 一切都已改变

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.070
This could be love again

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.070
那大概就是再次爱上你吧

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.050
All I need is you

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.050
我想要的 只有你

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.070
Comeback, I'm waiting, Anytime

回来吧 无论何时 我都在等待着你

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.110
The heavy rains come

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.110
大雨倾泻而下

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.290
Still I miss days with you

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.290
而我仍怀念着 你一同度过的时光

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.340
I can't look into your face

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.340
我不敢再面对你

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:27.150
Oh Feeling blue and looking back again

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:27.150
回首往事 悲恸将我湮没

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:59.240
